# Welcome to The Enetworks backend respository
```
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best We have to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `app.py`and a `requirments.txt` file that you can use to install the packages and then run the app (so it can start the backend and api routes), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a `models.oy` file for schemas and database models dependency.
